Implementation of Aerial-Vehicle-Geofencing-System.

This project aims to implement the Aerial-Vehicle-Geofencing-System.

Detecting cars from aerial views using geofencing can be achieved through a combination of aerial imagery, geofencing techniques, and object detection algorithms. The goal is to monitor and detect cars within a specific geographical area from aerial imagery, triggering alerts or notifications when cars are detected within the defined geofence.

The choice of framework that has been used is Pytorch.
